# TikTok-Live-Analytics

This app was made to analyze TikTok lives, 
for now, it's showing all gifts that were given to the host during the live session, 

it will start collecting and calculating coins from the moment you start the app.

## Data
during each session all data will be collected in a class, that can be used in the console.
```js
db            // this will show all data
db.coins()    // coins
db.total()    // coins converted to an actuall currency, to USD, and SAR
db.topUsers() // a list of all users who sent gifts.
```

## Fixes
if the app stopped working then try to update dependencies and also use this command in the terminal
```
npm update
```
